  <h2>Introduction to Bits and Bytes</h2>
  <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Understand bits and bytes, their relationship to computers, and how they are used to process and store information.</p>
  <p>In digital computing, everything is represented in bits and bytes. Each bit, short for "binary digit," is the smallest unit of data in computing. It holds a value of either 0 or 1, which is essential to the binary system, also known as the base-2 system.</p>

  <h2>Importance of Binary in Computing</h2>
  <p>Binary is foundational to computing and digital electronics. Unlike the more familiar decimal system, which uses ten symbols (0-9), binary represents each position as an increasing power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> The binary number <strong>1011</strong> translates to 11 in decimal because:</p>
  <p><code>1 × 2<sup>3</sup> + 0 × 2<sup>2</sup> + 1 × 2<sup>1</sup> + 1 × 2<sup>0</sup> = 11</code></p>
  <p>This simple yet powerful structure allows computers to represent complex data and perform operations in a straightforward way.</p>

  <h2>Combining Bits to Represent Complex Data</h2>
  <p>While a single bit can only hold a very small amount of information, combining multiple bits allows us to represent more complex data.</p>
  <p>A byte is a group of 8 bits. This grouping provides a larger range of values, which makes bytes a more practical unit for storing information. With 8 bits in a byte, we can represent 256 different combinations (from <code>00000000</code> to <code>11111111</code> in binary). This is enough to represent things like letters, numbers, and simple symbols.</p>

  <h2>Binary in Electronics and Digital Data</h2>
  <p>Binary's simplicity aligns with how electronic circuits operate, using on-off (high-low) states to represent data and perform calculations. This makes binary the foundational language of computers, allowing even complex information to be processed in straightforward on-off signals.</p>
  <p>Understanding binary is key to exploring how computers work and how data is represented digitally.</p>
