  <h2>Binary vs. Decimal Numbers</h2>
  <p><strong>What is a Number System?</strong></p>
  <p>A number system is a way of counting and representing numbers. Just like we have different languages to communicate, we have different systems to count things.</p>
  <p><strong>Main Number Systems:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Decimal (Base-10), which we use every day.</li>
    <li>Binary (Base-2), which is used by computers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>[Class discussion: "Why do you think computers use a different way of counting than we do?"]</em></p>

<div id="slide2">
  <h2>The Decimal System (Base-10)</h2>
  <p>The decimal system is the counting system we use every day. It’s based on 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.</p>
  <p>Each place value in a decimal number represents a power of 10:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hundreds place: 10<sup>2</sup></li>
    <li>Tens place: 10<sup>1</sup></li>
    <li>Units place: 10<sup>0</sup></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Let's look at the number 145 in decimal:</p>
  <p>145 = (1 × 10<sup>2</sup>) + (4 × 10<sup>1</sup>) + (5 × 10<sup>0</sup>)</p>
  <p>This means 145 is made up of 1 hundred, 4 tens, and 5 units.</p>
</div>

<div id="binary-system-slide1">
  <h2>The Binary System (Base-2)</h2>
  <p>The binary system is used by computers and only has 2 digits: 0 and 1. In binary, each place value represents a power of 2 instead of 10:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>4s place: 2<sup>2</sup></li>
    <li>2s place: 2<sup>1</sup></li>
    <li>1s place: 2<sup>0</sup></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="binary-system-slide2">
  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>In binary:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The rightmost digit represents 2<sup>0</sup>,</li>
    <li>The middle digit represents 2<sup>1</sup>,</li>
    <li>The leftmost digit represents 2<sup>2</sup>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To find the decimal (base-10) value of <strong>101</strong> in binary, we calculate each position's value and add them up:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (leftmost digit) × 2<sup>2</sup> = 1 × 4 = 4</li>
    <li>0 (middle digit) × 2<sup>1</sup> = 0 × 2 = 0</li>
    <li>1 (rightmost digit) × 2<sup>0</sup> = 1 × 1 = 1</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Total:</strong> 4 + 0 + 1 = 5</p>
</div>

  <h2>Another Example: Understanding Binary Conversion</h2>
  <p>Let’s look at the binary number <strong>101</strong>:</p>
  <p>
    ( 101 = (1 × 2<sup>2</sup>) + (0 × 2<sup>1</sup>) + (1 × 2<sup>0</sup>))
  </p>
  <p>This equals <strong>5 in decimal</strong> because ( 4 + 0 + 1 = 5 ).</p>
</div>

  <h2>Why Do Computers Use Binary?</h2>
  <p>Computers use binary because it’s simple and efficient for them to process. Each "1" or "0" represents an "on" or "off" electrical state, making binary perfect for electronic devices that operate with two states.</p>
  <p><strong>Real-World Connection:</strong> Think of a light switch—it’s either “on” or “off”. Computers work in a similar way!</p>
  <p><em>[Class discussion: "Can you think of other examples of things that are either ‘on’ or ‘off’?"]</em></p>

  <h2>Comparison of Binary and Decimal</h2>
  <p><strong>Visual Table:</strong></p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Decimal (Base-10)</th><th>Binary (Base-2)</th></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>10</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>11</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>100</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td><td>101</td></tr>
    <tr><td>6</td><td>110</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7</td><td>111</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td><td>1000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>9</td><td>1001</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> As you go down the table, notice that each new binary place doubles the previous value - just as each decimal place increases by 10 times.</p>

  <h2>Practice Activity: Converting Decimal to Binary</h2>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> What is 6 in binary?</p>
  <p><strong>Solution:</strong> 6 in binary is 110 because:</p>
  <p>110 = (1 × 2<sup>2</sup>) + (1 × 2<sup>1</sup>) + (0 × 2<sup>0</sup>)</p>
  <p>Which equals 4 + 2 + 0 = 6.</p>
  <p><em>[Class discussion: "Why is 6 represented as 110 in binary? What does each ‘1’ mean?"]</em></p>

  <h2>Summary of Binary vs. Decimal</h2>
  <p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The decimal system has 10 digits (0-9) and each place is a power of 10.</li>
    <li>The binary system has 2 digits (0 and 1) and each place is a power of 2.</li>
    <li>Computers use binary because it’s efficient to represent data as "on" (1) and "off" (0) signals.</li>
  </ul>
